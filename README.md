# advent_of_code
My solutions for the [adventofcode.com](http://adventofcode.com) challenges.

Some of the code in this repo was not written by me and in most cases is commented accordingly. I did not use anyone else's code before I came up with my own solution, and the code that I borrowed was so that I might reference it later, learn something new, or becasue I just thought it looked interesting. Testing a webhook.
